# Before you begin

> I really prefer unix environments. Ubuntu is my favorite distro, and one that I have actually been a core contributor of. If you're on Windows, I highly recommend dual-booting with Ubuntu or running a virtual machine.

You will need a computer running windows, mac or linux. Go is easy to install on most systems and I have used it reliably on every major architecture. You will also need to install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [node package manager (npm)](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node). I apologize if you run into complications getting your environment setup. For most, the process is fairly easy, but there are so many cases that I can't account for nor would I want to bore all readers with the information. Therefore, I can only encourage you to use MacOS or Ubuntu as an operating system, and wish you luck in overcoming the hurdles of programming on Windows.

Take a minute and get your environment setup... Or don't and continue reading.

## Conventions used in the book

A lot of books dive into things without letting you test along the way. While it's excusable from an author's point of view, it is not an ideal situation for a novice programmer. I'm going to be quite verbose in documenting every single step as we go through this book. My goal is to teach you how to write code, and then test the results every time we teach a new concept.

>> `Project/README.md`

> ```markdown
> Hello, reader
> ```



You will often find code in a formatted block like you see here. I will use this style of formatting to group lines of code together, without overwhelming you with too much information. If at any point, you want to see the lines of code in the context of the full file, you can preview the code fullscreen by clicking the expand icon next to the block. **Give it a try by clicking the "Hello, reader" block**.


`Project/README.md`

> ```markdown
> \\ start new code
> Hello, reader
> \\ end new code
> ```

## Setting up your project folder

Pick a folder to store all your program files in. I like to put mine in `/home/Projects/my-project` but you can put it wherever you like. We are going to break away from convention a little bit in order to get up and running and teaching you core concepts. Folder structure and naming conventions is hardly important at this point. Wherever you decided to put your folder, just know that throughout this book I'm going to refer to this project folder as `Root`.
